# **PawfectMatch API**

The PawfectMatch API is a Django API for [PawfectMatch](https://github.com/Julia-Wagner/PawfectMatch), a platform to connect shelters with loving homes for their dogs. Shelters can register and post their dogs, share stories and photos. Future dog owners can register to look for dogs.

# **Planning**

I detailed planning process using the 5 UX planes is described in the [PawfectMatch repository](https://github.com/Julia-Wagner/PawfectMatch?tab=readme-ov-file#planning).

## **User Stories**

I created separate user stories for the API from the user stories defined for the frontend part of the project using the same epics to group them.

I also decided to add these stories to the [project board](https://github.com/users/Julia-Wagner/projects/4) in the main repo instead of creating a separate backend board. This way the entire development process is visible in one board.

### **Epic: User Authentication**

## **Database Schema**

After defining the needed features for the application, I started creating my database schema. I tried to think of the best way to connect dogs and posts and how to efficiently upload different types of media for posts.

I decided to create a separate *media* table, this way the user can uploas multiple images for a post and not just the main image.

![Database Schema](docs/screenshots/database_schema.png)\
*Database Schema for PawfectMatch*

After finishing  my project, I exported an ERD from Django following [this tutorial](https://www.wplogout.com/export-database-diagrams-erd-from-django/). It shows all of my apps and models with my custom models **BannedWord**, **Media**, **Dog** and **DogCharacteristic** with the created tables. As well as other necessary relations, like the tables created by the **allauth** package.

# **Features/Apps**

The features of the PawfectMatch API can be broken down to apps. Here is a short summary of each app. All apps include automated testing, further described in the [Testing](#testing) section.

## **Comments App**

Instead of adding comments to posts, my project allows comments for profiles. Logged-in users can create comments and edit and delete their own comments. 

Besides the **Comment** model, I added a **BannedWord** model. This allows superusers to add banned words in the admin panel. Banned words are enforced in comments to ensure appropriate usage. If a comment contains a bad word, it will not be posted and the user gets an error message.

**API Endpoints:**
- `/comments/`: to list (**GET**) or create (**POST**) comments.
- `/comments/:id/`: to show (**GET**), update (**PUT**) or delete (**DELETE**) a comment.

## **Dogs App**

Dogs can only be managed by users with the profile type *shelter*. To ensure this, I added the custom permission **IsShelterOrReadOnly**. Logged-in shelters can create dogs and edit or delete their own dogs.

Besides the **Dog** model, I added a **DogCharacteristic** model. Characteristics can be created, edited, and deleted by superusers in the admin panel. Existing characteristics can be linked to dogs. I decided to prevent normal users from creating, updating or deleting characteristics and instead allow them to pick from the predefined ones created by superusers.

I created a custom **DogFilter** to allow filtering dogs by their characteristics and other fields.

**API Endpoints:**
- `/dogs/`: to list (**GET**) or create (**POST**) dogs.
- `/dogs/:id/`: to show (**GET**), update (**PUT**) or delete (**DELETE**) a dog.
- `/dogs/characteristics/`: to list (**GET**) dog characteristics.
- `/dogs/characteristics/:id/`: to show (**GET**) a dog characteristic.

## **Followers App**

I adapted this app from the Code Institute walkthrough project. Logged-in users can follow and unfollow other users.

**API Endpoints:**
- `/followers/`: to list (**GET**) or create (**POST**) follows.
- `/followers/:id/`: to show (**GET**), delete (**DELETE**) a follow.

## **Medias App**

I decided to create a separate *medias* app instead of adding an image field to the post. The reason for this is that I want to allow users to upload multiple images and even videos for posts and also dogs. This way the app can be used for both [Posts](#posts-app) and [Dogs](#dogs-app).

Logged-in users can add images or videos to posts or dogs. The custom permission **IsShelterOrReadOnly** is used to ensure only shelter users can create medias for dogs.

## **Posts App**

Posts can be viewed by all users. Only logged-in users can create, update and delete a post. Multiple dogs can be linked to a post.

Posts can be filtered and searched.

**API Endpoints:**
- `/posts/`: to list (**GET**) or create (**POST**) posts.
- `/posts/:id/`: to show (**GET**), update (**PUT**) or delete (**DELETE**) a post.

## **Profiles App**

A Profile is automatically created for each user at registration. Details can be added to each profile by updating it.

Comments can be added to profiles and profiles can be filtered.

**API Endpoints:**
- `/profiles/`: to list (**GET**) profiles.
- `/profiles/:id/`: to show (**GET**) or update (**PUT**) a profile.

## **Saves App**

Similar to followers, saves can either be created or deleted, but not updated. Logged-in users can save posts.

**API Endpoints:**
- `/saves/`: to list (**GET**) or create (**POST**) saves.
- `/saves/:id/`: to show (**GET**), delete (**DELETE**) a save.

# **Testing**

Please refer to the separate [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

# **Deployment**

Here is the [link to the deployed project](https://pawfect-api-dacc0c5bf00c.herokuapp.com/).

## **Create Repository**

The first step is to create a new repository, using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). After creating the repository, you can open it in the IDE of your choice.

If you choose to work in a local IDE, it is important to create a **virtual environment** before continuing. I am using PyCharm, where the local environment can be conveniently set up by adding a new interpreter. Another way is by typing `python -m venv .venv` in the terminal.

## **Project Setup**

1. Install **Django**:
   - `pip install 'django<4'`
2. Create a Django project:
   - `django-admin startproject <name>`
3. Install supporting **libraries**:
   - `pip install django-cloudinary-storage`
   - `pip install Pillow`
4. Create **requirements.txt** file:
   - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
   
## **Database Setup**

You can use a database of your choice, following are the instructions if you use [ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/).

1. Log in to your account
2. Click *Create New Instance*
3. Give the instance a name and select the plan of your choice, *Tiny Turtle* is the free plan.
4. Click *Select Region* and choose a data center near you
5. Click *Review* and if the details are correct click *Create instance*
6. Click on the created instance and copy the database URL

## **Cloudinary Setup**

1. Log in to your [Cloudinary](https://console.cloudinary.com/) account
2. At the dashboard, copy the link from the **API Environment variable**

## **File Changes**

1. In the **settings.py** file add this code:
    ```
    import os
    import dj_database_url
   
    if os.path.isfile("env.py"):  
        import env
    
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
    DEBUG = "DEVELOPMENT" in os.environ
   
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
    ```
2. In the **env.py** file add this code and ensure the file is added to *.gitignore*:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "addSecretKeyHere"
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "TRUE"
    os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]= "copiedDatabaseURL"
    os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "copiedCloudinaryURL"
    ```
3. After these changes, run `python manage.py migrate` to migrate your database structure to the ElephantSQL database.
4. In the **settings.py** file add this code to link to Cloudinary:
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [...
      'cloudinary_storage',
      'django.contrib.staticfiles',
      'cloudinary',
    ...]
   
    # NOTE: the second line should already be in the file, add the line above and below, the order is important)
   
    STATIC_URL = 'static/'
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ```

## **JWT Setup**

1. Install **dj-rest-auth**:
   - `pip install dj-rest-auth==2.1.9`
2. Add INSTALLED_APPS in **settings.py**:
   - `'rest_framework'`
   - `'rest_framework.authtoken'`
   - `'dj_rest_auth'`
   - `'django.contrib.sites'`
   - `'allauth'`
   - `'allauth.account'`
   - `'allauth.socialaccount'`
   - `'dj_rest_auth.registration'`
3. Add urls to main app **urls.py**:
   - `path('dj-rest-auth/', include('dj_rest_auth.urls'))`
   - `path('dj-rest-auth/registration/', include('dj_rest_auth.registration.urls'))`
4. Set SITE_ID in **settings.py**:
   - `SITE_ID = 1`
5. Install **simplejwt**:
   - `pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt`
6. Add JWT to **settings.py**:
    ```
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [(
            'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication'
            if 'DEV' in os.environ
            else 'dj_rest_auth.jwt_auth.JWTCookieAuthentication'
        )],
        'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':
            'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
        'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
        'DATETIME_FORMAT': '%d.%m.%Y',
    }
    if 'DEV' not in os.environ:
        REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES'] = [
            'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
        ]
    
    REST_USE_JWT = True
    JWT_AUTH_SECURE = True
    JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = 'my-app-auth'
    JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = 'my-refresh-token'
    JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'
    ```
7. Migrate database:
   - `python manage.py migrate`
   
## **Heroku Setup**

1. Log in to your [Heruko](https://www.heroku.com/) account
2. On the dashboard click *New* - *Create new app*
3. Give the app a unique name
4. Select the region closest to you and click *Create app*
5. Select your created app and open the *Settings* tab 
6. At the *Config Vars* section click *Reveal Config Vars* and add the following:
   - **DATABASE_URL** with the copied URL from ElephantSQL
   - **SECRET_KEY** with your secret key
   - **CLOUDINARY_URL** with the copied URL from Cloudinary
   - **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** with the value 1
   - **ALLOWED_HOST** with the value of your deployed Heroku application URL

## **Final Changes**

1. Add `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["PROJECT_NAME.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]` in **settings.py**
2. Create a **Procfile** file in the base directory
3. Add to **Procfile**:
    - `release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`
    - `web: gunicorn <name>.wsgi`
4. In your **Heroku app**: 
   - Go to the *Deploy tab* and connect your GitHub repository
   - Click on *Deploy Branch* at the bottom of the page
