## **Manual Testing**

I tested each app manually while creating the views in the DRF API interface.

## **Automated Testing**

I created and performed automated unit tests for each app. I structured my tests according to my views and tested each HTTP request and the applicable permissions. 

I installed *coverage* to check the testing coverage for my code. Using the *.html* report, I managed to find untested parts and add tests for these.

My total coverage for my unit tests is **98%**, with **100%** for all custom apps except for two. The medias serializer can not be fully tested automatically as it checks the uploaded size and file type for the image or video. And the posts view filter to check if a post has linked dogs was not tested automatically. I made sure to test these two apps again manually.

## **Validation**

### **Python Validation**

To ensure that my code follows Pep8 style guidelines, I installed [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). I ran the linter on my whole project, only excluding the *venv* and *.devcontainer* directory to avoid errors from external packages.

After fixing line-lengths and unused imports only errors for line-lengths in the *.env* file, a few migration files and the *settings.py* file are left.

As in my last project, the only real error coming from a file that I changed was **F401 'env' imported but unused** from the *settings.py* file. Because I added this code following the Code Institute walkthrough projects, I decided to leave the statement as is. I also tried to remove the unused import, but then the application fails to run locally. So it seems the import is actually not unused and the error might be a misinterpretation from Flake8.

## **Bugs and Fixes**

Thanks to the automated unit tests I found some bugs, mainly due to incorrect permissions. There are no known bugs that are not resolved.

One issue that took a lot of time while developing was allowing the upload of videos. After a lot of research, I found out that I need to use **VideoMediaCloudinaryStorage** to allow the upload of videos to Cloudinary. However, that requires the package **python-magic**. As I am using a *Windows* device, I installed **python-magic-lib** for Windows. Uploading videos then worked locally, but after trying to deploy it on Heroku the build failed.\
After many more hours of research and trying different solutions, I realized that the problem is that Heroku runs on *Linux* and therefore canÂ´t install the Windows-specific package. I found the solution in [this article](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic/issues/248) to download the magic files and save them on my device for *python-magic* to work locally without the Windows package.
